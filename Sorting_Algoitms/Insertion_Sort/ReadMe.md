## Overview
SO, Imagine given a list of number in random, you want them sorted.
the insertion sort takes in two integers side by side; if one is greator than 
the other then it keeps in the same index; if one integer is less than it 
moves to the left of the array. This happens as the list moves accross until
all numbers have been touched/looked at.

3. Out put Sorted array (line 43)
