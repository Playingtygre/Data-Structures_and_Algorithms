# Level-order printout of a K-ary Tree
K-ary trees are similar to binary trees but have no left or right.
K-ary trees are linked by children pointing to the parent instead.
the K-ary tree itself, since it has no left or right instead must go line by line.

## Challenge
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a k-ary tree. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a string that contains a listing of all values in the tree, with new lines in-between each level of the tree.
