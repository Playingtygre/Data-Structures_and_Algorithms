# FizzBuzz Tree
We had learned about binary trees, part of what make binary trees so powerful is that 
they can be traversed and looked threw. Part of what the coding challenge is today is
to perform a replacing of Nodes. If a node is divisible by 3 or 5 replace with
fizz, buzz or both.  This will finally change the tree.


## Challenge
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it.
Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.
