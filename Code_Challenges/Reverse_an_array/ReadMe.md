## reverseArray
Binary search can be used to find a value within a one-dimensional array with 
O(log n) time complexity and O(1) for space. This can result in a much faster
search than simply iterating over every value in the array, which would
incur an O(n) time complexity.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

### Example
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] ==> [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
