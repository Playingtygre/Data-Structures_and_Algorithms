# Merge two Linked Lists
So we have two singly linked list and we need to merge them together.

## Challenge

Write a function called mergeLists which 
takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked
lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between
the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single
list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have 
access to the Node class and all the properties on the
Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous
challenges.
