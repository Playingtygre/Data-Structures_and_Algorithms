# Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
So this week we are learning about taking in two stacks and a Queue. This coding Challenge provides manipulation of a queue using two stacks.

## Challenge
Implement the following methods for the Queue class:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
You have access to 2 Stack instances with push and pop methods.
