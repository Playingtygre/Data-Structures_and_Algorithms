## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in two parmeters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the elment does not exist.

### Example
    [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 15       -> 2
    [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77], 90 -> -1
